# This file defines extra metadata for including within Silver Lab NWB files.
# Lines beginning with '#' characters are comments, and are mostly ignored by the software.
# They are read, however, and the comments in experiments->template are displayed as
# tool tips by the MetadataEditor GUI.
# We use ruamel.yaml, which is derivative of PyYAML (See https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)
# For a guide to the base syntax see http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#YAMLsyntax

# The first section defines information about researchers. The keys here are their
# 'User' fields as given in LabView.

experiments:
    # Settings for particular experiments come next. This allows easy reuse of methods
    # information, etc. that is common to many sessions. Each experiment is identified
    # by a short label that is referenced in the session section at the end of this file.
  template:

devices:
# This section describes the hardware devices that could be used during an experiment.
# At present we assume the first 3 are always used, and the cameras are used iff
# corresponding video files are present.
# In the future this will need to be rig-specific, and the session below will indicate
# which rig was used.
# NB: The names used here must not be changed, as they are referenced within the code. However the
# descriptions can be improved upon.
# TODO: Include the make & model of camera, etc.
