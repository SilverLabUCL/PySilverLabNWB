      location: >
        Anatomy gross description of imaging location, e.g. vermis, visual cortex, depth of recording.
      # We should also have a more detailed 'reference_frame' for each imaging plane, which describes
      # position and reference frame of manifold based on position of first element in manifold.
      # For example, text description of anotomical location or vectors needed to rotate to common
      # anatomical axis (eg, AP/DV/ML). Not sure of the best way to input this, given we have lots of
      # imaging planes! TODO.
    stimulus_details:  # Required, until it is recorded by Labview!

        source: air_puff_device  # Must match a device in the devices section
        description: "Air puff stimulus"
        comments: "Delivered 'instantaneously' at the specified times"

# This section describes the hardware devices that could be used during an experiment.
# At present we assume the first 3 are always used, and the cameras are used iff
# corresponding video files are present.
# In the future this will need to be rig-specific, and the session below will indicate
# which rig was used.
# NB: The names used here must not be changed, as they are referenced within the code. However the
# descriptions can be improved upon.
# TODO: Include the make & model of camera, etc.
devices:
  AOL_microscope: "Random access 3d acousto-optic lens two-photon microscope"
  mouse_wheel_device: "Records mouse speed data"
  air_puff_device: "Delivers an air puff stimulus to the mouse's whiskers"
  BodyCam: "90Hz video camera viewing the mouse body"
  EyeCam: "30Hz video camera viewing the mouse face"
  WhiskersCam: "300Hz video camera viewing the mouse's whiskers"

# This section records the last 'session' by each researcher. The definitions are used
